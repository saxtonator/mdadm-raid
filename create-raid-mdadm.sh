# Here's how to configure RAID 0 on your EC2 instance using two or more newly attached EBS volumes. 
: <<'STEP1'
Step 1: Connect to Your Instance
First, you need to SSH into your EC2 instance. Use the following command:
STEP1
: <<'STEP2'
Step 2: List the Newly Attached Volumes
Once you're logged in, you can list the attached disks using the lsblk command. This will help you identify the device names of your newly attached EBS volumes.You'll see output like xvdf, xvdg, etc. for your attached volumes.
STEP2
lsblk
: <<'STEP3'
Step 3: Install mdadm
mdadm is a utility for managing and monitoring software RAID devices. Install it using:
STEP3
sudo yum install -y mdadm
: <<'STEP4'
Step 4: Create the RAID 0 Array
Assuming your new volumes are identified as /dev/xvdf and /dev/xvdg, you can create a RAID 0 array with the following. This command creates a RAID array named /dev/md0.
STEP4
sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/xvdf /dev/xvdg # don't forget to change this to match your volume names.
: <<'STEP5'
Step 5: Create a File System
You can create a file system on the RAID array. For example, using the ext4 file system.
STEP5
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0
: <<'STEP6'
Step 6: Mount the RAID Array
Create a directory to mount the RAID array and then mount it:
STEP6
: <<'STEP7'
sudo mkdir /mnt/raid0
sudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raid0
Step 7: Update /etc/fstab for Automatic Mounting
To ensure the RAID array mounts automatically at boot, you need to add an entry to /etc/fstab. First, find the UUID of the RAID array:
STEP7
sudo blkid /dev/md0
: <<'STEP7_1'
Then, add the following line to /etc/fstab using your favorite editor (like nano or vim). Replace your-uuid with the UUID you obtained from the blkid command.
STEP7_1
: <<'STEP8'
UUID=your-uuid /mnt/raid0 ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2 # don't forget to update this to match your RAID UUID.
Step 8: Ensure the RAID Array Assembles on Boot
To ensure the RAID array assembles automatically on boot, add the array details to the mdadm configuration file.
STEP8
echo 'DEVICE /dev/xvdf /dev/xvdg' | sudo tee -a /etc/mdadm.conf # update to match your volume name and details.
sudo mdadm --detail --scan | sudo tee -a /etc/mdadm.conf
: <<'STEP9'
Step 9: Testing and Verification
Finally, test the RAID setup:
Check the RAID array detail: sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0
Reboot the system and ensure everything mounts correctly: sudo reboot
After reboot, check if RAID is mounted: df -h
And that's it! You've configured a RAID 0 array on your Amazon Linux 2023 EC2 instance. Remember that RAID 0 does not provide any data protection, so itâ€™s wise to have backups for your data.
